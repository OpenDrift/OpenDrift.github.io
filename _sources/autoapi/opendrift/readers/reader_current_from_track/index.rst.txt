.. py:class:: Reader(obslon, obslat, obstime, obsfile=None, wind_east=0, wind_north=0, windreader=None, wind_factor=0.018, name=None)

   Bases: :class:`opendrift.readers.basereader.BaseReader`, :class:`opendrift.readers.basereader.ContinuousReader`

   An abstract reader. Implementors provide a method to read data and specify how it is interpolated.

   This class inherits :class:`.variables.Variables` which inherits :class:`.variables.ReaderDomain`. `ReaderDomain` is responsible for the extent and domain of the reader, including checking for out-of-bounds and projection conversion. `Variables` is responsible for returning interpolated data at the requests positions or profiles. Apart from coercing the returned data into the right type for :py:mod:`opendrift.models.basemodel`, it defines the abstract interface to :meth:`.variables.Variables._get_variables_interpolated_` which reader-implementations must provide (_usually_ through one of the main reader-types, see: :py:mod:`opendrift.readers`).

   .. seealso::

       :py:mod:`opendrift.readers`.

       :py:mod:`.variables`.

   Reader which statistically extrapolate current forcing.
   It uses the residual track obtained by subtracting the wind forcing component
   from the past observed motion of a particle.

   .. attribute:: variables
      :annotation: = ['x_sea_water_velocity', 'y_sea_water_velocity']

      

   .. method:: get_variables(self, requested_variables, time=None, x=None, y=None, z=None)

      Method which must be implemented by all reader-subclasses.

      .. warning::

          Warning: In the future this method is likely to be a requirement of
          each reader, and it will be up to the reader-type how values are
          retrieved.

      Obtain and return values of the requested variables at all positions
      (x, y, z) closest to given time.

      Arguments:
          variables: string, or list of strings (standard_name) of
          requested variables. These must be provided by reader.

          time: datetime or None, time at which data are requested.
          Can be None (default) if reader/variable has no time
          dimension (e.g. climatology or landmask).

          x, y: float or ndarrays; coordinates of requested points in the
          Spatial Reference System (SRS) _of the reader (NB!!)_.

          z: float or ndarray; vertical position (in meters, positive up)
          of requested points. default: 0 m (unless otherwise documented by reader)

          block: bool, see return below

        Returns:
          data: Dictionary

          keywords: variables (string)

          values:

          - 1D ndarray of len(x) if StructuredReader. Nearest values
              (neighbour) of requested position are returned.

          - 3D ndarray encompassing all requested points in
              x,y,z domain if UnstructuredReader. It is task of invoking
              application (OpenDriftSimulation) to perform
              interpolation in space and time.
