---------------


.. py:class:: Lagrangian3DArray(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`opendrift.elements.LagrangianArray`

   Extending LagrangianArray for elements moving in 3 dimensions
   The Particle may be buoyant and/or subject to vertical mixing
   buoyant bahaviour is described by terminal velocity

   .. attribute:: variables
      

      


.. py:class:: OpenDrift3DSimulation(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation`

   Open source buoyant particle trajectory model based on OpenDrift.

   Developed at MET Norway

   Generic module for particles that move in 3 dimensions
   and may be to vertical turbulent mixing
   with the possibility for positive or negative buoyancy

   Particles could be e.g. oil droplets, plankton, nutrients or sediments

   Under construction.

   .. attribute:: max_speed
      :annotation: = 1

      

   .. method:: update_terminal_velocity(self, Tprofiles=None, Sprofiles=None, z_index=None)


      Calculate terminal velocity due to bouyancy from own properties
      and environmental variables
      overload this function to create particle-specific behaviour


   .. method:: vertical_advection(self)


      Move particles vertically according to vertical ocean current

      Vertical advection by ocean currents is small compared to
      termical velocity


   .. method:: prepare_vertical_mixing(self)



   .. method:: surface_stick(self)


      To be overloaded by subclasses, e.g. downward mixing of oil


   .. method:: bottom_interaction(self, Zmin=None)


      To be overloaded by subclasses, e.g. radionuclides in sediments


   .. method:: surface_wave_mixing(self, time_step_seconds)


      To be overloaded by subclasses, e.g. downward mixing of oil


   .. method:: get_diffusivity_profile(self, model)



   .. method:: vertical_mixing(self)


      Mix particles vertically according to eddy diffusivity and buoyancy

      Buoyancy is expressed as terminal velocity, which is the
      steady-state vertical velocity due to positive or negative
      buoyant behaviour. It is usually a function of particle density,
      diameter, and shape.

      Vertical particle displacemend du to turbulent mixing is
      calculated using a random walk scheme" (Visser et al. 1996)


   .. method:: plot_vertical_distribution_new(self, maxdepth=None, numtimes=5)


      Function to plot vertical distribution of particles


   .. method:: plot_vertical_distribution(self)


      Function to plot vertical distribution of particles


   .. method:: plotter_vertical_distribution_time(self, ax=None, mask=None, dz=1.0, maxrange=-100, bins=None, step=1)


      Function to plot vertical distribution of particles

      use mask to plot any selection of particles
