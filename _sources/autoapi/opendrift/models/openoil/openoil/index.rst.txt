.. py:module:: opendrift.models.openoil.openoil

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   OpenOil is a 3D oil drift module bundled within the OpenDrift framework.

   The oil weathering calculations is based on the NOAA-ERR-ERD OilLibrary
   package, which is installed as a dependency. The code for evaporation and
   emulsification in OpenOil is borrowed from the NOAA PyGnome code, and adapted
   to the OpenDrift architecture.

   Oil properties affecting the drift
   ***********************************
   The vertical (and thus indirectly also the horizontal) motion of oil (droplets) is affected by oil density and droplet diameters.

   When using the NOAA oil weathering model (``o = OpenOil(weathering_model='noaa')``), which is the default, the density is obtained from the NOAA database according to the oiltype selected when seeding. This value can not be overridden by the user, and it will also change during the simulation due to oil weathering processes (evaporation and emulsification).

   The droplet diameter may be given explicitly when seeding, e.g.:

   .. code::

       o.seed_elements(4, 60, number=100, time=datetime.now(), diameter=1e-5)

   In this case, the diameter will not change during the simulation, which is useful e.g. for sensitivity tests. The same diameter will be used for all elements for this example, but an array of the same length as the number of elements may also be provided.

   If a constant droplet diameter is not given by the user, it will be chosen randomly within given config limits for a subsea spill ('blowout'), and modified after any later wave breaking event. Oil droplets seeded under sea surface (z<0) will be assigned initial diameters between the following limits, typical for a subsea blowout (Johansen, 2000)::

   .. code::

       o.set_config('seed:droplet_diameter_min_subsea', 0.0005)  # 0.5 mm
       o.set_config('seed:droplet_diameter_max_subsea', 0.005)   # 5 mm

   Note that these config settings must be adjusted before the seeding call.
   After each wave breaking event, a new droplet diameter will be chosen based on the config setting for droplet size distribution.

.. py:class:: Oil(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`opendrift.models.oceandrift.Lagrangian3DArray`

   Extending LagrangianArray with variables relevant for oil particles.

   Initialises a LagrangianArray with given properties.

   Args:
       Keyword arguments (kwargs) with names corresponding to the
       OrderedDict 'variables' of the class, and corresponding values.
       The values must be ndarrays of equal length, or scalars.
       All (or none) variables must be given, unless a default value
       is specified in the OrderedDict 'variables'
       An empty object may be created by giving no input.

.. py:class:: OpenOil(weathering_model='noaa', *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`opendrift.models.oceandrift.OceanDrift`

   Open source oil trajectory model based on the OpenDrift framework.

   Developed at MET Norway based on oil weathering parameterisations
   found in open/published litterature.

   Under construction.

   Initialise OpenDriftSimulation

   Args:
       seed: integer or None. A given integer will yield identical
           random numbers drawn each simulation. Random numbers are
           e.g. used to distribute particles spatially when seeding,
           and may be used by modules (subclasses) for e.g. diffusion.
           Specifying a fixed value (default: 0) is useful for sensitivity
           tests. With seed = None, different random numbers will be drawn
           for subsequent runs, even with identical configuration/input.
       iomodule: name of module used to export data
           default: netcdf, see :py:mod:`opendrift.io` for more alternatives.
           `iomodule` is module/filename without preceeding `io_`
       loglevel: set to 0 (default) to retrieve all debug information.
           Provide a higher value (e.g. 20) to receive less output.
           Use the string 'custom' to configure logging from outside.
       logtime: if True, a time stamp is given for each logging line.
                logtime can also be given as a python time specifier
                (e.g. '%H:%M:%S')

   .. py:method:: update()

   .. py:method:: get_oil_budget()

      Get oil budget for the current simulation

      The oil budget consists of the following categories:

      * surface: the sum of variable mass_oil for all active elements where z = 0
      * submerged: the sum of variable mass_oil for all active elements where z < 0
      * stranded: the sum of variable mass_oil for all elements which are stranded
      * evaporated: the sum of variable mass_evaporated for all elements
      * dispersed: the sum of variable mass_dispersed for all elements

      The sum (total mass) shall equal the mass released. Note that the mass of oil
      is conserved, whereas the volume may change with changes in density and
      water uptake (emulsification). Therefore mass should be used for budgets,
      eventually converted to volume (by dividing on density) in the final step
      before presentation.

      Note that mass_oil is the mass of pure oil. The mass of oil emulsion
      (oil containing entrained water droplets) can be calculated as:

      .. code::

          mass_emulsion = mass_oil / (1 - water_fraction)

      I.e. water_fraction = 0 means pure oil, water_fraction = 0.5 means mixture of
      50% oil and 50% water, and water_fraction = 0.9 (which is maximum)
      means 10% oil and 90% water.

   .. py:method:: store_oil_seed_metadata(**kwargs)


   .. py:method:: seed_elements(*args, **kwargs)

      Seed elements with given position(s), time and properties.

      Arguments:
          lon: scalar or array
              central longitude(s).
          lat: scalar or array
              central latitude(s).
          radius: scalar or array
              radius in meters around each lon-lat pair,
              within which particles will be randomly seeded.
          number: integer, total number of particles to be seeded
              If number is None, the number of elements is the
              length of lon/lat or time if these are arrays. Otherwise
              the number of elements are obtained from the config-default.
          time: datenum or list
              The time at which particles are seeded/released.
              If time is a list with two elements, elements are seeded
              continously from start/first to end/last time.
              If time is a list with more than two elements, the number of elements
              is equal to len(time) and are seeded as a time series.
          radius_type: string
              If 'gaussian' (default), the radius is the standard deviation in
              x-y-directions. If 'uniform', elements are spread evenly and
              always inside a circle with the given radius.
          kwargs:
              keyword arguments containing properties/attributes and
              values corresponding to the actual particle type (ElementType).
              These are forwarded to the ElementType class. All properties
              for which there are no default value must be specified.


   .. py:method:: seed_cone(*args, **kwargs)

      Seed elements along a transect/cone between two points/times

      Arguments:
          lon: scalar or list with 2 elements [lon0, lon1]

          lat: scalar or list with 2 elements [lat0, lat]

          time: datetime or list with 2 elements [t0, t1]

          radius: scalar or list with 2 elements [r0, r1] Unit: meters

          number (int): The number of elements. If this is None, the number of
          elements is taken from configuration.

      Elements are seeded along a transect from
          (lon0, lat0) with uncertainty radius r0 at time t0, towards
          (lon1, lat1) with uncertainty radius r1 at time t1.
          If r0 != r1, the unceetainty radius is linearly changed along
          the transect, thus outlining a "cone".
