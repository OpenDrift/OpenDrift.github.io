.. py:class:: OceanDrift(*args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation`

   Open source buoyant particle trajectory model based on OpenDrift.

   Developed at MET Norway

   Generic module for particles that move in 3 dimensions
   and may be to vertical turbulent mixing
   with the possibility for positive or negative buoyancy

   Particles could be e.g. oil droplets, plankton, nutrients or sediments,
   Model may be subclassed for more specific behaviour.


   Initialise OpenDriftSimulation

   Args:
       seed: integer or None. A given integer will yield identical
           random numbers drawn each simulation. Random numbers are
           e.g. used to distribute particles spatially when seeding,
           and may be used by modules (subclasses) for e.g. diffusion.
           Specifying a fixed value (default: 0) is useful for sensitivity
           tests. With seed = None, different random numbers will be drawn
           for subsequent runs, even with identical configuration/input.
       iomodule: name of module used to export data
           default: netcdf, see :py:mod:`opendrift.io` for more alternatives.
           `iomodule` is module/filename without preceeding `io_`
       loglevel: set to 0 (default) to retrieve all debug information.
           Provide a higher value (e.g. 20) to receive less output.
           Use the string 'custom' to configure logging from outside.
       logtime: if True, a time stamp is given for each logging line.
                logtime can also be given as a python time specifier
                (e.g. '%H:%M:%S')

   .. py:method:: update()

      Update positions and properties of oil particles.


   .. py:method:: get_oil_budget()

      Get oil budget for the current simulation

      The oil budget consists of the following categories:

      * surface: the sum of variable mass_oil for all active elements where z = 0
      * submerged: the sum of variable mass_oil for all active elements where z < 0
      * stranded: the sum of variable mass_oil for all elements which are stranded
      * evaporated: the sum of variable mass_evaporated for all elements
      * dispersed: the sum of variable mass_dispersed for all elements

      The sum (total mass) shall equal the mass released. Note that the mass of oil
      is conserved, whereas the volume may change with changes in density and
      water uptake (emulsification). Therefore mass should be used for budgets,
      eventually converted to volume (by dividing on density) in the final step
      before presentation.

      Note that mass_oil is the mass of pure oil. The mass of oil emulsion
      (oil containing entrained water droplets) can be calculated as:

      .. code::

          mass_emulsion = mass_oil / (1 - water_fraction)

      I.e. water_fraction = 0 means pure oil, water_fraction = 0.5 means mixture of
      50% oil and 50% water, and water_fraction = 0.9 (which is maximum)
      means 10% oil and 90% water.


   .. py:method:: plot_oil_budget(filename=None, ax=None, show_watercontent_and_viscosity=True, show_wind_and_current=True)


   .. py:method:: get_oil_name()

   .. py:method:: set_oiltype_by_id(oiltypeid)

      Sets the oil type by specifying the ADIOS ID. See the `ADIOS database <https://adios.orr.noaa.gov/oils>`_ for a list. OpenDrift provides a small set of extra oils.

   .. py:method:: set_oiltype_from_file(path)

      Sets the oil type by specifing a JSON file. The format should be the same as the ADIOS database. See the `ADIOS database <https://adios.orr.noaa.gov/oils>`_ for a list.

   .. py:method:: store_oil_seed_metadata(**kwargs)


   .. py:method:: seed_elements(*args, **kwargs)

      Seed elements with given position(s), time and properties.

      Arguments:

              central longitude(s).
          lat: scalar or array
              central latitude(s).
          radius: scalar or array
              radius in meters around each lon-lat pair,
              within which particles will be randomly seeded.
          number: integer, total number of particles to be seeded
              If number is None, the number of elements is the
              length of lon/lat or time if these are arrays. Otherwise
              the number of elements are obtained from the config-default.
          time: datenum or list
              The time at which particles are seeded/released.
              If time is a list with two elements, elements are seeded
              continously from start/first to end/last time.
              If time is a list with more than two elements, the number of elements
              is equal to len(time) and are seeded as a time series.
          radius_type: string
              If 'gaussian' (default), the radius is the standard deviation in
              x-y-directions. If 'uniform', elements are spread evenly and
              always inside a circle with the given radius.
          kwargs:
              keyword arguments containing properties/attributes and
              values corresponding to the actual particle type (ElementType).
              These are forwarded to the ElementType class. All properties

          time: datetime or list with 2 elements [t0, t1]

          radius: scalar or list with 2 elements [r0, r1] Unit: meters

          number (int): The number of elements. If this is None, the number of
          elements is taken from configuration.

      Elements are seeded along a transect from
          (lon0, lat0) with uncertainty radius r0 at time t0, towards
          (lon1, lat1) with uncertainty radius r1 at time t1.
          If r0 != r1, the unceetainty radius is linearly changed along
          the transect, thus outlining a "cone".
