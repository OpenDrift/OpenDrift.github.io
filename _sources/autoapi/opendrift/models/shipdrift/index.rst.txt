.. py:class:: ShipObject(**kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`opendrift.elements.LagrangianArray`

   Extending LagrangianArray with variables relevant for leeway objects.

       

   Initialises a LagrangianArray with given properties.

   Args:
       Keyword arguments (kwargs) with names corresponding to the
       OrderedDict 'variables' of the class, and corresponding values.
       The values must be ndarrays of equal length, or scalars.
       All (or none) variables must be given, unless a default value
       is specified in the OrderedDict 'variables'
       An empty object may be created by giving no input.

.. py:class:: ShipDrift(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation`

   Demonstration trajectory model based on OpenDrift framework.

   Simply advects a particle (passive tracer with
   no properties except for position) with the ambient wind.

   Initialise OpenDriftSimulation

   Args:
       proj4: proj4 string defining spatial reference system.
           If not specified, SRS is taken from the first added reader.
       seed: integer or None. A given integer will yield identical
           random numbers drawn each simulation. Random numbers are
           e.g. used to distribute particles spatially when seeding,
           and may be used by modules (subclasses) for e.g. diffusion.
           Specifying a fixed value (default: 0) is useful for sensitivity
           tests. With seed = None, different random numbers will be drawn
           for subsequent runs, even with identical configuration/input.
       iomodule: name of module used to export data
           default: netcdf, see :py:mod:`opendrift.io` for more alternatives.
           `iomodule` is module/filename without preceeding `io_`
       loglevel: set to 0 (default) to retrieve all debug information.
           Provide a higher value (e.g. 20) to receive less output.
           Use the string 'custom' to configure logging from outside.
       logtime: if True, a time stamp is given for each logging line.
                logtime can also be given as a python time specifier
                (e.g. '%H:%M:%S')

   .. method:: seed_elements(self, *args, **kwargs)

      Seed elements with given position(s), time and properties.

      Arguments:
          lon: scalar or array
              central longitude(s).
          lat: scalar or array
              central latitude(s).
          radius: scalar or array
              radius in meters around each lon-lat pair,
              within which particles will be randomly seeded.
          number: integer, total number of particles to be seeded
              If number is None, the number of elements is the
              length of lon/lat or time if these are arrays. Otherwise
              the number of elements are obtained from the config-default.
          time: datenum or list
              The time at which particles are seeded/released.
              If time is a list with two elements, elements are seeded
              continously from start/first to end/last time.
              If time is a list with more than two elements, the number of elements
              is equal to len(time) and are seeded as a time series.
          radius_type: string
              If 'gaussian' (default), the radius is the standard deviation in
              x-y-directions. If 'uniform', elements are spread evenly and
              always inside a circle with the given radius.
          kwargs:
              keyword arguments containing properties/attributes and
              values corresponding to the actual particle type (ElementType).
              These are forwarded to the ElementType class. All properties
              for which there are no default value must be specified.


   .. method:: update(self)

      Any trajectory model implementation must define an update method.
      This method must/can use environment data (self.environment) to
      update properties (including position) of its particles (self.elements)


   .. method:: import_ascii_format(self, filename)
