Comparing Leeway and ShipDrift model
====================================

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-12

The Leeway model contain many object categories from persons-in-water
to various types of boats and ships.
Here we compare the Leeway model with a fishing vessel to
the ShipDrift model using the same ship dimensions.

We use a simple case with constant wind northwards, and no current.
Wave height and period is calculated automatically from wind,
and wave direction is the same as wind direction

For the Leeway model we use "FISHING-VESSEL-3" with a length of 62m
For the ShipDrift model we define a ship with the same dimensions,
as well as a "large ship" scaled up by a factor of 8

We see that the overall drift speed of the ShipDrift model
is comparable to the Leeway model.
However, the Leeway model yields a much larger directional
spread for ships orienters left and right respectively.
For the scaled up ship, the drift speed is slightly larger,
and the directional spread is slightly larger, but still
much smaller than with the Leeway model.
